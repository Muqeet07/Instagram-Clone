# Instagram-Clone
I have created an Instagram Clone using ReactJs as Frontend and Firebase as Backend. This Project includes user authentication/ authorization also. An authorized user can upload pics and caption and can also comment on others posts. I have also added the Update and Delete post functionality in this project. This project is also Responsive.
